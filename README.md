The granular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an evolutionary specialization of primates that is centrally involved in cognition. Here, we assessed over 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. While most transcriptomically-defined cell subtypes are conserved, we detected several subtypes only in some species and substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between translation of the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production, in certain interneurons, and also by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene *FOXP2*, which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer-4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates.
