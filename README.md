## Molecular and cellular evolution of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

The granular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an evolutionary specialization of primates that is centrally involved in cognition. Here, we assessed over 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. While most transcriptomically-defined cell subtypes are conserved, we detected several subtypes only in some species and substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between translation of the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production, in certain interneurons, and also by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene *FOXP2*, which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer-4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates.
