### Brief description
The granular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an evolutionary specialization of primates that is centrally involved in cognition. Here, we assessed over 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. While most transcriptomically-defined cell subtypes are conserved, we detected several only in some species and substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production, in certain interneurons, and also by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2, which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer-4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates.


### Data Availability

The cross-species dlPFC snRNA-seq data (raw and processed) were deposited in the NEMO Archive (RRID:SCR_002001) under identifier nemo:dat-zkgd0it accessible at [https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-zkgd0it](https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-zkgd0it). 

The data can also be interactively visualized at [resources.sestanlab.org/PFC](http://resources.sestanlab.org/PFC/). 

The human dlPFC sn-multiome data were deposited at NCBI GEO under the accession number: [GSE207334](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE207334).
